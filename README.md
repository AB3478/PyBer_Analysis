# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
PyBer, a python-based ride sharing company, has requested analysis and a graph examining the total weekly fares for each city type. This written summary provides an overview of how the data differs by city type and provides three business recommendations for addressing disparities among urban, suburban, and rural cities. The goal of this analysis is to improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Resources
- Data sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv 
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.11
- Python 4.13.0

## Analysis of Results

The greatest differences in PyBer's ride-sharing data were between urban and rural cities. The number of total urban rides was 1,625, while the total number of rural rides was 125. Between January - April 2019, PyBer's urban total fares were nearly $40,000, while the company's rural fares were $4,327 during that same time period. Rural drivers reported significantly higher average fares, at $55.49, while an urban driver's average fare was $16.57. Pyber's rural rides were also more costly with the average fare at $34.62; urban fares were on average ten dollars less ($24.53).

The multiple line graph highlights the wide range in total fares by city type. It also highlights the beginning of January as a relative low point for fares with a peak across all city types in late February.
