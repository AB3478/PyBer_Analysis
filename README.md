# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
PyBer, a python-based ride sharing company, has requested a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This report provides a summary of how the data differs by city type and provides three business recommendations for addressing disparities among urban, suburban, and rural cities.  The goal of this analysis is to improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Resources
- Data sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv 
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.11
